/* Instead of relying on specificity alone, we can add more specificity to the intended style (e.g., by adding a class): */
.specific-element {
  color: blue;
}

/* Or, as a last resort and only if absolutely necessary, use the !important flag, but keep in mind this can make your stylesheet harder to maintain: */
#myElement {
  color: red !important;
}

/*  Note: Using !important is generally discouraged unless absolutely necessary for overriding a third-party style you cannot modify */
